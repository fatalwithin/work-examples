How to verify your domain

    Add your domain or subdomain.
    Open your DNS provider and add the two TXT DNS records provided.
    If you want Mailgun to track clicks and opens you can also add the CNAME record.
    MX records should also be added, unless you already have MX records for your domain pointed at another email service provider (e.g. Gmail).

Once you’ve added the records and they’ve propagated, your domain will be verified.

Note

It can take 24-48 hours for DNS changes to propagate.

If you will be creating a lot of domains, Mailgun offers an API endpoint for adding/editing/removing domains from your account. See the Domains endpoint for more information.
